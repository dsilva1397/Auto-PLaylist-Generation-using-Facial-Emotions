# Auto-PLaylist-Generation-using-Facial-Emotions
A Thesis project for my Masters in AI in which I will try to analyse an individuals / groups facial emotion into 3 main categories and provide songs according to that.


Here we will use Vision Based Techinque that will be our input to a Deep-Learning Model.
This is a Classification Project, hence we wont measure the intensity of the emotion but just classify the Emotion.
We will classify our input as 7 classes -> Fear, Angry, Neutral, Disgust, Surprised, Sad and Happy.
